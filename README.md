This project was designed to help me and my friends decide on which restaurant we wanted to visit on the weekend.
All of my friends want to choose the restaurant we go to, and we are always in some disagreement as to where we will go.

This app allows users to input restaurant names, which are then shuffled using a Fisher-Yates shuffle algo, and winners are then randomly decided from the ensuing matchups. The App depicts a tournament style competition, where each restaurant faces up against another in either the Quarter Finals, Semi Finals or Finals. The Winner is finally chosen and depicted on screen.

I used a lot of React trickery to try and determine the winners and reset the rounds as efficiently as possible.

I used Zustand for global state management.
